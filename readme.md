# Files Encrypt 

## Description

```
This Program takes in input and 
returns the content encrypted
```


### Encryption

All the files with "Encryption" in the name
do as the filename says (DirectoryEncyrption encrypts all files in a directory)

and etc.

The Key is in Cle.txt and is accessed through Key.py
I do not encourage this in practice
The Testing was done on everything named testing
